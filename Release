Math::Integral::Romberg - Numeric integration of single-variable functions

This Perl package numerically integrates single-variable functions
over a finite interval using the Romberg method.  It takes a
reference to a function, the two limit values, and various optional
error thresholds, and returns the area of the function between those
two points.

I doubt it has any bugs, but I've numbered it 0.01 anyway to be
conservative.
